# Flashcard-app

Created an application that allows users to create, edit, and delete decks and cards within them.

Created a REST API and middleware functions to allow user(s) to create, read, update and delete their perfect deck of study cards.

Defined routes and URLs, and used state over multiple components.

Technology: JavaScript, React, Express, Knex, HTML, and CSS. Progress/Versions tracked with Git.

This project was designed to test my ability to work with rendering and state management using React.

It helped demonstrate my capabilities of installing packages via NPM, running tests from the command line, writing React function components, creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router, using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory(), debugging React code through console output and using the VS Code debugger.

Plans to come back and improve some lines of code to better my skills and further improve and polish some techniques.
